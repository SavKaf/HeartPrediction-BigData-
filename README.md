# HeartPrediction

As part of the AIVC Master's "Big Data Management and Visualization" course at UNIWA, I did a data analysis and forecasting project.

- The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).
The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4.238 records and 15 attributes.
Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral and medical risk factors.
For CHD (10 year risk of coronary heart disease): '1' means 'Yes', '0' means 'No'.
