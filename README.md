# HeartPrediction-BigData-

In the context of the 'Big Data Management and Visualization' course of the university
of UNIWA, I ended up doing a data analysis and prediction task.

# The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).
# The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4.238 records and 15 attributes.
# Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral and medical risk factors.
# For CHD (10 year risk of coronary heart disease): '1' means 'Yes', '0' means 'No'.
